### Hi there 👋

<!--
**JLElias/JLElias** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on thermal analysis for graphene aerogel and initial funding proposal calculations for MPDT cathode erosion mitigation techniques.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning physics of electric propulsion and plasmadynamics.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on weird things that might be useful eventually
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with whatever current density means
- 💬 Ask me about gardening and rare plants
- 📫 How to reach me: email
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have the largest collection of two endangered palm species in the US.
